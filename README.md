This project perform classification on human face images and animal face images using the PCA + KNN approach.

In the `/src` folder, there are 7 files that you can run on Google Colab. 

To run `0_olivetti_faces.ipynb`, you do not need to manually import any dataset.

If you would like to run `1_avengers_initial.ipynb`, `2_avengers_k_fold_best_model.ipynb`, or `3_avengers_k_fold_majority_vote`.ipynb, you need to add [this folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1yl5pHsYguXTTH71NkYJ2RDh9lFxIoV0D?usp=sharing) to your Google Drive and modify the `human_path` in the ipynb file to where the avengers dataset locates in your Drive. 

If you would like to run `11_animal_initial.ipynb`, `12_animal_k_fold_best_model.ipynb`, or `13_animal_k_fold_majority_vote.ipynb`, you need to add [this folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1S9z4aGttSyy6ITzYw2R4tdH8kHBpysuQ?usp=sharing) to your Google Drive and modify the `animal_path` in the ipynb file to where the avengers dataset locates in your Drive.
